## Hi there 👋
Hi, I'm Scabbards! You can call me 1500 or 00. I'm currently a senior undergraduate student, primarily focusing on medical deep learning, with occasional forays into data-related projects. My mental state is barely holding up, thanks to the unwavering support of Sanae Kochiya🐸🐍. 

As I'm in the midst of application season, updates here may be slow. That said, I warmly welcome everyone to connect, learn, and collaborate with me! 😊
